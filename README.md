### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working for Microsoft as a software engineering manager for Visual Studio IntelliCode. Additionally, I get to invest my time in several technology interests such as iOS/macOS programming, open source development, child-friendly software and hardware, and artificial intelligence. You can also find me in <a rel="me" href="https://hachyderm.io/@DavidObando">Mastodon</a>.
